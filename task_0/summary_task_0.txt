Git course on Udacity is very well structured and quite fun. I liked that they have short videos that are focused clearly on one idea and also have a lot of quizes, concept maps and reflections to absorb the new info. I really understood for myself that “We do not learn from experience…we learn from reflecting on experience.”

Also course is using the older version of Git with message 'No commits yet', instead of 'Initial commit' in newer version, therefore some quizes give a false negative, not a big deal, but anyway, sent that to them in a feedback form.

The try.github.io resource is probably more relevant for people who like reading more than doing online courses. I personally like online courses more. But try.github.io has a nice cheat sheet with commands and also will be useful to come back to in case when I'll need to recall some information.
